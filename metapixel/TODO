* 1.1.0

open files binary in rwimg

test suite

check all asserts

** feature access

color spaces in rc and batch files

put matching score properly into protocol (i.e. not as comment)

make flipping option available to metapixel-prepare and document the
default (seems to be x, but none is probably better)

** antimosaics

implement antimosaics or remove them

for antimosaics: allow result image meta-size to be different than
deconstructing size.

** documentation

document: library format not compatible, metapixel.xml, batch files

check doc updates in 1.0 branch

b/w matching either with "-Chsv -W0,0,1" or "-Cyiq -W1,0,0"

** packaging

spec from 1.0 branch

* 1.1.1

scaling doesn't seem to round correctly - 255 becomes 252 or 251

C# bindings

api docs

utility for working with protocols, like merging two protocols into
one, taking N best matches from protocol A and the rest from B

* later

compare channels in the order of their weights, i.e. if third channel
has largest weight, compare it first

don't store all color space coeffs in metapixel - compute them in a
pass before the mosaic creation and store them in an array

make wavelet work again.  problem: the coeffs would have to be saved
for each color space separately.

use multiple threads for mosaic creation (create thread library to
unify with mathmap)

make zoom multi-threaded, too

use multiple threads/processes for preparation - give multiple image
arguments to metapixel --prepare

filter for small images based on aspect ratio (and do all other
filtering there, too).  for generating mosaics as well as for adding
images to libraries.

filter for adding images to libraries based on checksum as well as
similarity to other images.

honor image orientation in EXIF data (esp in JPEGs) - use libexif

flipping in metapixel-prepare

Document flipping (?)

Fix the FIXMEs

***

for 0.11:

debian package: http://packages.debian.org/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?searchon=names&version=all&release=all&keywords=metapixel

***

document batch mode

implement classic mosaics with nonstandard tiling, i.e., triangles and
hexagons.

implement masks for collages

implement larger tiles

TEST: everything from the start: prepare, then do mosaics of all
kinds.

DONE:

metapixel should check whether it can open the small images, otherwise
the output image is garbage !!!!!!!!!!!!

metapixel-prepare should check if it can really run metapixel (if it's
in path).

allow more than one tables file
