Changes since version 0.10:

  * The tables files must now always be in the directory where the
    small images reside, and that directory is now called a "library".

  * Metapixel can now take default values for its settings from a
    configuration file in the user's home directory (".metapixelrc").

  * Bugfixes

Changes since version 0.9:

  * Metapixel can now enforce a minimum image distance for
    collages.

  * metapixel-prepare can now traverse the image directory
    recursively (courtesy of Jake Di Toro).

  * The tables file must now no longer be redirected to stdin
    but it's name must be given to the option '--tables'.
    This option can be used several times, so more than one
    tables file can be read.

  * The default minimum distance for classical mosaics is
    now 5 instead of 0.

  * A rudimentary man page is now included (courtesy of
    Debian's Chris Vanden Berghe).

  * Reading the tables file is now more than twice as fast.

  * bugfixes
